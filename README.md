<!-- This is your starter code for Iteration 1.

There is quite a lot of example code in this production template that you don't
want or need down the road, but is included to help you get started.
As you work on your project, you should replace these pieces with
elements of your project and _remove whatever you don't need_ (e.g., markdown
files, JSON data files, or any remnants of the labs). We include, for example,
the `User` parts of the previous labs. These are almost certainly not relevant
to your project and should be removed once you've started.

:bangbang: Keeping things like the support for our `User` types will
artificially inflate your test coverage results, making it look like you have
much better coverage than you actually do. This is neither cool nor helpful,
so you really should remove our code fairly early in your iteration.

:exclamation: You should remove this sentence and the text above, and
replace them with at least an elevator pitch description of your project so that
if someone comes to this repo they'll know what the project is about. -->

<!-- ## [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md)

Instructions on setting up the development environment and working with the code are in [the development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Common commands

From the `server` directory:

- `./gradlew run` to start the server
- `./gradlew test` to test the server
- `./gradlew checkstyleMain` to run Checkstyle on the server Java code in the `src/main` folder
- `./gradlew checkstyleTest` to run Checkstyle on the server Java code in the `src/test` folder
- `./gradlew check` will run the tests, run the Checkstyle checks, and generate coverage reports in one command

From the `client` directory:

- `ng serve` to run the client
- `ng test` to test the client
  - Or `ng test --no-watch --code-coverage` to run the client tests once and
    also compute the code coverage.
- `ng e2e` and `ng e2e --watch` to run end-to-end tests

From the `database` directory:

- `./mongoseed.sh` (or `.\mongoseed.bat` on Windows) to seed the database

## [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md)

Instructions on how to create a DigitalOcean Droplet and setup your project are in [the deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## [Resources](RESOURCES.md)

Additional resources on tooling and techniques are in [the resources list](RESOURCES.md).

## Changing the name

The project by default has the name "CSCI 3601 Iteration Template". There are a few places you need to change to make this the name you want:

- The title in this README.md
- [`client/src/app/app.component.ts`](client/src/app/app.component.ts)
  - The `title` variable
  - Also the associated unit and E2E tests will need to be changed.
- [`client/src/app/app.component.html`](client/src/app/app.component.html)
  - The `mat-toolbar` element for the navigation drawer is just "Client" by default.
- [`client/src/index.html`](client/src/index.html)
  - The `title` element

You can go ahead and remove this section of the README once you have changed the name.

## Getting Started

Play Generic Apples game here (https://134.122.12.152.nip.io/)

## What is Generic Apples Game?

GENERIC APPLES GAME is a multiplayer party game inspired by popular card games like "Cards Against Humanity" and "Apples to Apples". Players take turns being the judge while others submit responses to prompts provided by judge, creating an engaging and entertaining social experience. 

The game revolves around a simple but engaging others: each round, one player (the Judge) presents a prompt or question, while other players submit their most creative or humorous responses. The Judge then selects their favorite response, and points are awarded accordingly.

### How to Play?

- Starting a Game:
- Create a new game
- Share the game code with friends with copy button
- Use game settings to adjust points and whio becomes the judge
- Start when ready

- During the Game:
- Judge types and shares the prompt
- Players submit responses
- Judge selects winning response
- Points are awarded
- Winner is displayed when certain points are reached 
- Next round begins


In each round, there's a Judge who evaluates responses, active Players who submit creative answers, and ultimately a Winner who first reaches the designated score. The game follows a straightforward yet engaging flow: it begins with one player being assigned as Judge, who presents a prompt to the group. Other players then submit their responses, trying to come up with a funny answer. The Judge reviews all submissions and selects their favorite, with points being awarded to the winning response. The Judge position then shifts according to the chosen game settings—either following a fixed rotation or passing to the round's winner.

The scoring system keeps players engaged throughout the game. Points are awarded each round to the player with the winning response. 

## Features

What sets Generic Apples apart are its adaptable features and user-friendly design. The game offers customizable settings that let players tailor their experience, including options for how the Judge role rotates and the ability to set different winning score thresholds. The number of players can also be adjusted to accommodate various group sizes. Thanks to WebSocket technology, all game actions—from submitting responses to updating scores—happen in real-time, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience for everyone involved. Some of the unique features are Customizable settings, Real time interaction, for card-playing freinds who can't be in person and want to enjoy having access to play card games in any location.
